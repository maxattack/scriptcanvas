The Beginning of a quirky little game engine for making delightful/weird tablet apps that have a 2D geometric style.

Wishlist:
* Efficient Entity-Component System
* Batched Rendering
* PhysFS-Based Modpacks (w/ git support?)
* Lua Scripting (bindings via tolua++)
* Box2D Telemetry
* Multithreaded Architecture, Asynchronous IO
* In-Engine UI & Content Editor
* Tracker & Procedural Audio
* PC, Mac, Tablet Build Targets
